My Hospital Management System is built using Java, JDBC, and SQL. It manages patient records, doctor details, appointments, and billing. 
I designed the database using multiple normalized tables like patients, doctors, and appointments to avoid redundancy. 
I used JDBC for connecting Java with SQL and performed CRUD operations using PreparedStatement. 
The challenging part was designing proper relationships and handling appointment conflicts, but I solved it using SQL joins and validation. 
Overall, the project helped me understand Java-SQL integration and real-world database design
